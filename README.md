# Titanic Accident Data Visualization
This project analyzes and visualizes historical passenger data from the Titanic disaster to identify patterns in survival rates.
It uses Python and various data visualization libraries to present the findings in an interactive and understandable format.

---
## Project Overview
- Objective: Examine how factors such as age, fare, passenger class, sex, and embarkation port influenced survival chances.
- Methodology:
  1. Load and preprocess the Titanic dataset.
  2. Handle missing values using imputation techniques.
  3. Create visualizations to reveal relationships and patterns.

## Visualizations
The notebook includes the following analyses:
- Scatter plot (Altair) showing the relationship between age, fare, and survival.
- Sunburst chart (Plotly) displaying the effect of embarkation port on survival rate.
- Stacked bar chart (Matplotlib) comparing survival counts by sex and passenger class.
- Heatmap (Plotly) showing survival percentages by age group and passenger class.
- Categorical plot (Seaborn) illustrating survival distribution across age groups.

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for static visualizations
- Altair and Plotly for interactive visualizations
- Google Colaboratory for running and sharing the notebook
